Anthony Baietto is a PhD Graduate from The Ohio State University. He earned his degree in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.osu.edu) working with [Dr. Christopher Stewart](https://people.engineering.osu.edu/people/stewart.962) and [Dr. Trevor Bihl](https://www.ohio.edu/engineering/about/people/bihlt) in collaboration with the [Air Force Research Laboratory](https://www.afrl.af.mil/). His research interests centered around computer systems, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural networks. His research explored novel neural network design approaches which leverage extant problem information to reduce the evergrowing sizes of models and datasets.

Anthony is currently an Artificial Intelligence Engineer with [Applied Research Solutions](https://www.appliedres.com/) where he uses AI/ML to automate time-consuming tasks to boost government/contracting personnel efficiency. His work revolves around the application of LLMs and other AI paradigms to perform large-scale data curation and task automation. He has developed several applications including RAG/chatbots, cybersecurity tools, system modeling tools, and document generators and has led development of multiple AI projects.

In his free time, Anthony enjoys working around the house, playing video games with his buddies, and spending quality time with his wife, daughter, and dog.
