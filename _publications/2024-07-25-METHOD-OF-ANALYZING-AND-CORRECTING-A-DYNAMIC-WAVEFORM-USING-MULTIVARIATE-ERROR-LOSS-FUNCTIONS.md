A method of analyzing and correcting a complex dynamic waveform, such as a radar wave or communication wave. The method comprises developing a loss function as the difference the actual characteristics and desired characteristics of the mean squared error and at least one of frequency-domain power, time-domain envelope, and frequency-domain phase. These differences are fed into a neural network to improve prediction correction to bring the actual waveform closer to a benchmark waveform. The method of the present invention displays increased accuracy over the prior art without increased computing time or sacrificing notch depth.
